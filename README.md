## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I knew the `<details>` tag has built in open and close functionality, so I wanted to leverage that and create this componente without JS.
-   The `<details>` tag has an `:open` attribute that you can use in css to make changes when it is open.

### Continued development

-   I want to continue creating simple and minimal solutions. Yes I could have used JS to build this and maybe I should have to test my knowledge, but I was able to create a solution that leveraged native elements and their functionalities. Because of that this page will load faster and be less prone to bugs.

### Useful resources
